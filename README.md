# WinForms-Memory-Game ðŸŽ´

* A classic memory card game developed on the .NET Framework using C#.
* For this project, my partner Ben Daniels and I developed clean and object oriented code, which uses delegates and allows users to interact with the WinForms library user interface.
* The game starts in the settings window and has his two modes, versus player or versus computer.
